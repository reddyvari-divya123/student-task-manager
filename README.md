## Architecture Overview
This project uses a three-tier architecture:
1. *Frontend (React.js)*  
   Provides an interactive UI for students to manage their tasks. Sends HTTP requests to the backend.
2. *Backend (Node.js + Express)*  
   Acts as the server layer, handling APIs and business logic. Interacts with the database to store and fetch task data.
3. *Database (MySQL)*  
   Stores user task data such as task name, status, and deadlines.
## Future Enhancements
- User login & authentication  
- Push notifications for upcoming deadlines  
- Task categorization and filtering  
- Calendar integration
